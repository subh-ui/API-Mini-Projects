API Mini Projects is a collection of small, focused Python projects that demonstrate how to work with various public APIs. Each project showcases how to fetch, process, and display data from real-world APIs using clean and readable Python code.

These projects are great for learning and practicing:

â€¢	Sending HTTP requests

â€¢	Working with external data sources

â€¢	Using API keys securely
